Title: Functions to simplify the creation of choropleths (thematic maps) in R.
Description: choroplethr simplifies the creation of choropleths in R. A
    choropleth is a thematic map where geographic regions such as states are
    colored according to some metric, such as which political party the state
    voted for. choroplethr supports four levels of geographic resolution and
    two types of scales. Common problems such as matching county data with map
    data, choosing and labeling discrete scales and creating a clean background
    are handled automatically. choroplethr provides native support for viewing
    data from the US Census's American Community Survey (ACS).
