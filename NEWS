choroplethr 1.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES
-Create 3 new functions which support a workflow of giving users more control of choropleths
  -get_acs_df, which gets an ACS table as a data.frame.  You can then use, for example, cut2 to discretize the values as you see fit.
  -bind_df_to_map, which binds a data.frame of (region, value) pairs to a state, county or zip map.
  -render_choropleth, which renders a choropleth from (map, value) pairs.

-Improve documentation

choroplethr 1.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES
  -Allow users to specify choropleths of a subset of states.  See the "states" parameter in ?choroplethr and ?choroplethr_acs.
  -choroplethr_acs now supports year and span fields.  See http://1.usa.gov/1geFSSj for a list of all ACS years with spans.  However, see http://www.census.gov/developers/data/ for a list of which ACS are available via the Census API.  Currently it is the 5-year surveys ending in 2010, 2011, 2012.  Thanks to Ezra Haber Glenn for clarifying this.

----------------------------------------------------------------

  -Add requirement of minimum R version of 3.0.0 in the DESCRIPTION file.  See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/choroplethr/Owv7NgAacGE for details.
